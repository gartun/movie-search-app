# Dummy Movie Search App For (Özgür Cinefil)[https://gartun.netlify.app/ozgur-cinefil/dist/home/index.html] 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It works as a _complementary feature_ for (one)[https://gartun.netlify.app/ozgur-cinefil/dist/home/index.html] of my other projects. 

## The Technologies Used For This App
- React.js library (as a framework)
- (react-query)[https://react-query.tanstack.com/] (for API calls)
- (react-paginate)[https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate] (for pagination)
- (react-loader-spinner)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner] (as indications for loading state while pulling the data from backend)
- react-router-dom (for routing)
